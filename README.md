# Days since last Rust Minecraft server

Funny little countdown :)

I'll stop maintaining this site once either of the following happen:
- One of them achieves full vanilla reimplementation
- I get bored of updating

Who knows which one will happen first! (LOL)


### Maintenance

Please PR (or create an issue) for any new servers!

Required info:
- Name
- URL (of source preferably, but documentation also works)
- Publish date (including basic proof, e.g. Reddit post)
