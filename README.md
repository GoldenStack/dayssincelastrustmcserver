# Days since last Rust Minecraft server

Funny little countdown :)

I'll stop maintaining this site once either of the following happen:
- One of them achieves full vanilla reimplementation
- I get bored of updating

Who knows which one will happen first! (LOL)


### Maintenance

Please create an issue (or PR) for any new servers!

Required info:
- Name
- URL (of source preferably, but documentation also works)
- Publish date (including basic proof, e.g. Reddit post)

Note: I am aware I am missing a few servers. This is because I could not find a
specific date when they were first "announced" to the world.

Here are some examples, although I am aware of more. Open an issue if you find
proof of them being announced!
- Hematite @ https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/hematite_server
- Quartz @ https://github.com/Rusty-Quartz/Quartz

### Disclaimer

No hate towards anyone :) It's always great to see a new Minecraft server in progress. I'm just poking a little fun at how many incomplete Rust implementations there are.
